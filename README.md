# Custom AlertDialog
This repository provides a simple example of how to create and display a custom dialog in an Android application. 

## Key Actions:

 - **Set the content view:** ```setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)``` sets the layout for the main activity which includes a Button that will trigger the dialog.
 - **Initialize dialog:** A new instance of Dialog is created with ```dialog = new Dialog(MainActivity.this)```.
 - **Set custom dialog layout:** ```dialog.setContentView(R.layout.custom_dialog)``` loads the custom dialog layout.
 - **Sets a background drawable:** setBackgroundDrawable() is used for the dialog, which is useful for customizing the appearance of the dialog's background.
